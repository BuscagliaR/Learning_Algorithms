This repository contains supervised learning algorithms used in the dissertation "Supervised and Ensemble Learning of
Multivariate Functional Data: Applications to Lupus Diagnosis", defended on May 10th, 2018, Arizona State University.

Provided are the functions used to produce all results presented within the dissertation.  Specific code is not given for any
values found within tables or figures.  Requests can be made to the author if specific code of interest is required.

The author hopes to maintain this repository and will provide more code for producing specific results with time.  As for now, 
only minimal code has been provided for running and obtain results found within the dissertation.  These are given only to 
provide a template for producing other results or using the algorithms created.

Annotations are often also missing.  Updates to annotations are also of future interest, so that fundamental code can be sharedat the author's new position.
